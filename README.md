A personal budget tracking application. Track your balances and transactions with bank connections or manual entry, categorize and analyze expenses and income, and many more.

PostgreSQL is an external dependency managed by `~/repos/shared-postgres`.
See the [setup and migration runbook](self-hosting/docs/external-postgres.md).

## Local Application setup

To set up the application locally, please refer to the [instructions here](./docs/application-setup.md).

## Self-hosting

Run Budget Tracker (MoneyMatter) on your own server: the stack pulls published multi-arch Docker images and exposes the whole app on a single port, so you front it with whatever reverse proxy you already run (Nginx Proxy Manager, Caddy, Traefik, …) – or use the optional bundled Traefik + Let's Encrypt overlay. See the [self-hosting guide](./self-hosting/README.md).

## Translations

The app ships in English, Ukrainian, Spanish and Indonesian. Corrections and new languages are welcome via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/moneymatter).
