# Budget Tracker – Self-Hosting

Run Budget Tracker on your own server with Docker Compose. The stack pulls
published multi-arch images and exposes the whole app on **one host port** –
put whatever reverse proxy you already run in front of it (Nginx Proxy
Manager, npmplus, Caddy, Traefik), or nothing at all for a LAN / localhost
trial.

## Quickstart

First [start shared-postgres and provision the application database](docs/external-postgres.md).
For an existing installation, follow the data migration procedure before upgrading.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/letehaha/budget-tracker.git
cd budget-tracker/self-hosting
cp .env.example .env   # then fill the REQUIRED section
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://<host>:8080`. Full walkthrough:
[setup guide](docs/setup-guide.md).
