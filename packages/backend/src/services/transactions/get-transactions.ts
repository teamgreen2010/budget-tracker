 * filtered on, so transactions an owner created on a shared account are visible to the
 * recipient too.
 *
 * If the caller passes `accountIds`, we intersect against the accessible set: accounts
 * not in scope are silently dropped (keeping behaviour identical to the previous
 * userId-scoped query for inaccessible accounts — empty result, not 403).
 *
 * If the caller passes `budgetIds`, visibility is widened: budget-share grants per-
 * budget visibility independent of which underlying account a tx lives in. A `read`+
 * recipient on a shared budget sees every tx attached to that budget, including
 * owner-attached rows on accounts the recipient doesn't otherwise have access to.
 * When both `budgetIds` and `accountIds` are provided, both filters apply (intersect).
 *
 * Recipient-attached rows on a shared budget carry an `addedBy` user snapshot so the
 * UI can label them ("Added by @bob"). Owner-attached rows leave `addedBy` undefined.
 *
 * Internal callers that should remain owner-scoped (csv-import, tag-reminders, budgets
 * stats, etc.) call `Transactions.findWithFilters` directly with `access: { creator }`.
